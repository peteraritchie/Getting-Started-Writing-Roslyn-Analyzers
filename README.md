# Getting-Started-Writing-Roslyn-Analyzers

This session will introduce you to the fascinating world of semantic code analysis. We've had static code analysis for a long time, and it does a lot of great things; but Roslyn provides developers the ability to semantically analyze code to detect richer problems. Roslyn also enables the ability to provide a fix for potential problems.

This session starts out with an overview of the types of Roslyn Analyzers then goes into the basics of semantic code analysis with Roslyn. An example of a NuGet package with a built-in semantic analyzer and walks through some of the library-specific analysis it performs
